# stylelint-unused-classes

## Purpose

Finds out possibly unused class selectors (`.my-class`) and id selectors (`#my-element`) by statically analyzing the source code that generates HTML.

Currently Erb and Haml are supported.

## Getting started

First, configure [`unused-classes`](https://npmjs.com/package/unused-classes).

Then install stylelint and stylelint-unused-classes:

```
npm install -D stylelint stylelint-unused-classes
# OR
yarn add -D stylelint stylelint-unused-classes
```

Configure `.stylelintrc.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["stylelint-unused-classes"],
  rules: {
    "unused-classes/unused-classes": [
      require.resolve("./classes.json"),
      {
        severity: "warning",
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Options

### Primary option

A string pointing to the file generated by `unused-classes`.
